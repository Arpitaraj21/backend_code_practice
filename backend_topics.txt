ðŸ”¹ 1. JavaScript Fundamentals for Backend
Even though you know JS, these are critical in backend too:

ES6+ features (let/const, arrow functions, spread/rest, destructuring)

Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await

Closures, Scope, Event Loop, Call Stack

Error Handling (try-catch, custom errors)

Array/Object methods (map, filter, reduce, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Node.js Core Concepts
Understand how Node.js works under the hood:

What is Node.js? V8 engine, single-threaded model

Node.js architecture (Event Loop, Event Queue, Libuv)

Global objects: __dirname, __filename, process, etc.

CommonJS & ES Modules (require vs import)

Built-in modules: fs, http, path, os, crypto, events, stream

ðŸ”¹ 3. NPM and Project Structure
NPM/Yarn â€“ installing, using packages

package.json and package-lock.json

Scripts in package.json

Project folder structure: routes/, controllers/, models/, middleware/

ðŸ”¹ 4. Express.js (Core Framework)
Creating a server with Express

Middleware (built-in, custom)

Routing: basic, nested, parameterized

Query params, route params

req, res, and next

Static files serving

Error handling middleware

Logging (using morgan or winston)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Working with Databases
ðŸ”¸ MongoDB (NoSQL) + Mongoose (ORM)
MongoDB basics: documents, collections

CRUD operations

Schema & Model design

Relationships (populate, refs)

Indexing and performance

ðŸ”¸ OR MySQL/PostgreSQL (SQL) + Sequelize/Knex
SQL basics: joins, constraints, normalization

Using Sequelize ORM for models and queries

ðŸ”¹ 6. RESTful API Development
What is REST? Principles and best practices

HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

HTTP Status Codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500, etc.)

Creating endpoints, versioning

Postman for testing APIs

ðŸ”¹ 7. Authentication & Authorization
JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Session vs Token-based auth

OAuth2 (basic understanding)

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Securing routes and APIs

ðŸ”¹ 8. Middleware & Advanced Express
Third-party middleware (CORS, Helmet, Body-parser)

Custom error handler

Async error handling using express-async-errors

Rate Limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit)

Input validation (e.g., Joi, express-validator)

ðŸ”¹ 9. File Uploads and Handling
Using multer for file uploads

Handling file paths, validation, and storage

Streaming large files

ðŸ”¹ 10. Environment Management
.env files and dotenv package

Managing secrets and configs securely

ðŸ”¹ 11. Testing and Debugging
Debugging with console, Chrome DevTools, or VSCode

Unit testing: Jest, Mocha, Chai, Supertest

Test structure and mocking

ðŸ”¹ 12. Error Handling & Logging
Centralized error handling

Logging errors to files/external services

Graceful shutdown of servers

ðŸ”¹ 13. Deployment & DevOps Basics
Hosting: Render, Railway, Heroku, Vercel, DigitalOcean

Using PM2 for process management

Nginx reverse proxy (basic)

CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

ðŸ”¹ 14. WebSockets & Real-Time Communication (Optional but Good to Know)
Socket.IO basics

Real-time chat or notification features

ðŸ”¹ 15. Advanced Topics
Caching (Redis, in-memory)

Rate Limiting

API Gateway (basic understanding)

GraphQL (optional)

Microservices intro

Serverless (AWS Lambda, Vercel functions)

âœ… Bonus: Tools You Should Be Familiar With
Postman, Insomnia (API testing)

Git & GitHub (version control)

ESLint + Prettier

Swagger or Postman documentation

Docker basics (optional but valuable)
