URL Shortener

1) Design a URL Shortener service that takes a valid URL and returns a 
Shortened URL, redirecting the user to the previously provided URL

Also, keep track of total visits/clicks on the URL

Routes:

POST/URL - Generates a new short URL and returns the Shortened URL in the format 
example.com/random-id

GET/:id - redirects the user to the original URL

GET/URL/analytics/:id - returns the clicks for the provided short id
